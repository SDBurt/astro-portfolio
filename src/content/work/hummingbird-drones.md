Technical Contributions:

1. Contributed to the FireAI Project as a full-stack developer - was the sole developer of the project until early 2022 where the company hired more talent. I used NextJS, TypeScript, Python, and Terraform for AWS resources.

2. My contributions leading up to the deployment of the MVP (start of 2022):

- Developed a dataset builder application in ReactJS.
- Fine-tuned an RCNN model for detecting hotspots.
- Implemented systems for converting image pixels to GPS coordinates and creating geo-referenced PDF maps.
- Deployed the NextJS application and associated pipelines on AWS.

3. Once the team expanded, my contributions were:

- Enhanced machine learning pipelines, improving model accuracy by approximately 20%.
- Maintained and upgraded GIS systems, including systems for GPS conversion and hotspot filtering.
- Supported front-end development.

Teamwork and Culture:

1. Worked closely with the CTO, Founders, and designers in both office and remote settings.
2. Contributed to brainstorming and architecture discussions.
3. Participated in code reviews and knowledge sharing.
4. Conscious of how remote-work can be isolating; actively worked to include and communicate daily with remote team-members.
